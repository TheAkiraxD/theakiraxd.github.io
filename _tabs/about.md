Hello there! 

<img style="float: left; margin: 10px 20px 0px 0px !important;" src="https://i.ibb.co/RyMr7Dj/CYMERA-20190623-215913-jpg.jpg" alt="drawing" width="170"/>

My name is **Maico Santos** and welcome to my personal blog. If you immediately assumed I am probably from a South America country, well, you are not wrong.
I was born in the sunny hot coast of Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· around 27 years ago. 
Currently, I live and work in the cold not-even-close-to-the-beach city of Montreal, in Canada, an astonishingly beautiful place.

I work as a Full Stack developer mainly with C#, Dot.NET, React, Docker and so on. But I already touched most of the now-days development languages. Once I even spent more than a semester obsessed with Machine Learning, where I built a very humble version of Flappy Bird with JavaScript but it learns how to play by itself (you can probably check that on my Github). I also made some other cool stuff that might not be there.
But yeah, coding has been part of my life for around 8 years now.

At this point you might think that this blog will be a portfolio for my coding projects or tutorials of coding, but it is not. 
To be honest, I already tried to do this kind of content a few times in the past but I was never commited enough to post quality content regularly. 
Then, what is this blog for? This blog is to display some content and progress of my new hobby: 3D modeling! (ooh boy!!)

So yeah, I am a software developer diving into the 3D modeling world, I decided to redirect my free time to something that can be profitable after some years and that also helps with my anxiety. Before that, I was very addicted to a game called Rocket League which wasn't profitable at all nor relaxing, since I am a very competitive person. 
I have not decided if I will limit blog's content to simply show my designs and my progress or if I will share some knowledge that I consider useful for other beginners. But I am happy to start somewhere and lets see how it goes.
