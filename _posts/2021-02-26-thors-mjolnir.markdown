Hello there.

In the [previous post]({% post_url 2021-02-25-my-first-model-caps-shield %}) I shared the first 3D model I ever make on Blender: The Captain America's shield.
I had to keep practicing and my second design idea would also make the Marvel fanbase proud: I choose to model Thor's Mjolnir.

For this project I watched some Youtube tutorial again. So, I would like to thank [CG Masters](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCxay0KiyLlawfgoZ2mVnNQ) for the great content.

<div style="border: 1px solid white; margin-bottom: 20px;">
<div id='canvas-holder' style="position: relative; width: inherit; border: 2px solid #1b1b1e">
  <div id="dat-gui-holder" style="position: absolute; top: 0em; right: 0em; z-index: 1;">
    <span style="margin-right: 5px;">* use your mouse to rotate the camera</span>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

I also started to use some reference images to help with scales and some small details of the design. Here's a nice one:

<img style="" src="http://www.brainfoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Thors-hammer.jpg" alt="Thor's hammer by brainfoo.com" width="400"/>

That's pretty much it for this design.

Enjoy :)
