[**TheAkiraxD.github.io**](https://theakiraxd.github.io/)

This is the repository of my personal website. The website was made using [**Jekyll 4.2.0**](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/releases/tag/v4.2.0) together with the [**jekyll-theme-chirpy**](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#readme).


## About

The main goal of this site is to talk about 3D modeling, but especially to display the 3D models I produced during this learning phase and further.
I might also create some posts with coding content since I am a software developer, but this haven't been decided yet.
In case you want to know more about the author (me) check it out the website's [**About**]() page. 

> Hints and suggestions are always welcome, so if you want to send me a message of any kind send an email to `williamsmaico@gmail.com`. I will decide what to answer based in the content of the message.


## 3D Models

I will keep the 3D models I make in the `/public/assets/models` folder, the models there can be used anywhere else with no problem, just don't forget to give the proper credits.

### Visualizing

The website is using [**Three.js**](https://threejs.org/) plugin. It allows the website to render 3D models in a very nice way. So, the posts I'm display my models will be using this feature.
You can use your mouse to rorate the camera of the 3D object, you can also zoom in and out using the scroll.

### Possible issues

Naturally, 3D model files can be large sometimes, I will always try to avoid posting unecessarily huge files, however, some files may be a bit big still and depending on the reader's internet speed it might take a few seconds to render the model in the page.
I will eventually add an option to show images of the model instead of its 3D rendering and give the reader the choice to toggle between one or another. For mobile, the images option might be set as default.
About *Three.js* it surely seems reliable, although, rendering 3D models in a webpage is an unnatural thing, so I am expecting casual issues to happen. I will also implement an easy way to report bugs directly from the website.

> As soon as any of those things are implemented, this README file will be updated.
